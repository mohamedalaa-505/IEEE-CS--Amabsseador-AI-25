1. Histogram
Purpose: Shows the distribution of continuous data by grouping values into bins (intervals).

Use Case: Analyzing frequency distributions (e.g., exam scores, age groups).

2. Stem and Leaf Plot
Purpose: Displays individual data points while preserving exact values.

Use Case: Small datasets where raw data visibility is important (e.g., test scores).

Difference vs. Histogram: Shows exact values, not binned frequencies.

3. Box and Whisker Plot (Box Plot)
Purpose: Summarizes data distribution using quartiles (median, IQR, outliers).

Use Case: Comparing distributions across categories (e.g., salaries by profession).

Difference vs. Histogram: Focuses on spread/outliers, not detailed frequency.

4. Dot Plot
Purpose: Represents individual data points as dots along an axis.

Use Case: Small datasets or comparing frequencies across categories.

Difference vs. Bar Chart: Shows exact counts per category without bars.

5. Pie Chart
Purpose: Displays parts of a whole as proportional slices.

Use Case: Showing percentage compositions (e.g., budget allocation).

Difference vs. Bar Chart: Best for single-series part-to-whole comparisons.

6. Bar Chart
Purpose: Compares categorical data using rectangular bars.

Use Case: Ranking or comparing discrete categories (e.g., sales by product).

Difference vs. Histogram: Bars are spaced apart (categorical, not binned numeric data).

7. Heatmap
Purpose: Visualizes matrix-like data using color intensity.

Use Case: Correlation matrices or geographic data (e.g., population density).

Difference vs. Others: Uses color gradients, not bars/dots.

8. Violin Plot
Purpose: Combines a box plot with a smoothed histogram (shows density).

Use Case: Detailed distribution analysis (e.g., bimodal data).

Difference vs. Box Plot: Reveals density peaks and valleys.

9. Symmetry and Skewness
Purpose: Describes data distribution shape (symmetric, left/right-skewed).

Use Case: Identifying bias or outliers in datasets.
